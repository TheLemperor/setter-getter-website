  <h1> Object Oriented Programming in Java</h1>
  <p> Unlike C++, Java is a much more class oriented programming language. This means that all files, including the main file, are essentially made up of a class. The main class is defined by the initial Java file name (like this: class App1) and the main program is defined as a method within the main class (public static void main(String[] args)).</p>
  <!-- This is a comment -->
  <p> In Java, every class contains attributes and methods. Attributes are properties that every object of the class contains. And like C++, these attribures can be set to public or private, or even constant and static.</p>
  <p> Despite its age, Java remains one of the most popular Object Oriented Programing languages in the world. It is still used widely in web development and in applications, including popular games like Minecraft.</p>
